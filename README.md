## Car Feature Analysis:

# Project Background:
The automotive industry has been rapidly evolving over the past few decades, with a growing focus on fuel efficiency, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation. With increasing competition among manufacturers and a changing consumer landscape, it has become more important than ever to understand the factors that drive consumer demand for cars.
In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards electric and hybrid vehicles and increased interest in alternative fuel sources such as hydrogen and natural gas. At the same time, traditional gasoline-powered cars remain dominant in the market, with varying fuel types and grades available to consumers.
For the given dataset, as a Data Analyst, the client has asked How can a car manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand?
